This project is made to learn reverse engineering, and patching 
binaries using python. Kind of crazy that you don't need any external 
python libraries to do this. Like it's possible to do this with python
right out of the box.

Of course this was made possible through the use of tools like Ghidra, and
x64dbg. To set this up, you have to compile the source code into an
executable, and run patch.py.
